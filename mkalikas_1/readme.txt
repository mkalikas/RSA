To execute the second part of the program, you must include all of the files from the first part including the files that are generated. You also need to use the files from the messageDigest library. You need to replace the main.cc file with the one I am providing. You also need to replace the Makefile with the one I am providing. You can run the program by first running the command make all. Then, you pass either ./main s followed by the name of a file, or ./main v followed by the name of two files. A file name, such as the one passed when running the program with s, or another file. The third fourth parameter has to be a .signed file, which is generated when ./main s and a file name is run. This .signature file contains the signature. The output of the program will tell you if the file has been modified or not when you run the program to verify.
